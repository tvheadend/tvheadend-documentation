####Menu Bar/Buttons

The following functions are available:

Button     | Function
-----------|----------
**Save**   | Saves any changes made to the recording list.
**Undo**   | Undo any changes made since the last save.
**Add**    | Add and configure a recording event by hand as opposed to choosing something from the EPG. This is useful if you wish to record something that isn’t yet in the EPG, or record at a particular time that perhaps spans several EPG events.
**Delete** | Delete the selected recording event. You will be prompted for confirmation.
**Abort**  | Abort an already-underway recording. Note that this does not remove the (partial) recording file from disk.
**Edit**   | Manually edit an already-scheduled recording event. This uses the same fields as **Add**, but they’re obviously pre-populated with their current values.
**Help**   | Display this help page.

![Detailed Recording Information](docresources/upcomingrecordings2.png)

**Rerun Of**
: If the recording is a repeat (rerun) this field will display the date the programme was previously broadcast.
Note that this field is dependant on your epg source.

**Title**
: The title (name) of the recording. While this is copied from the EPG
when you create a recording, it’s not used to match the event itself and
is thus used here as the name of the event (see also: adding an event
manually with the **Add** button).

**Subtitle**
: The programme episode title if available.
Note that some broadcasters (especially in the UK on Freeview) incorrectly insert the programme synopsis into the
subtitle section of the OTA EPG data.

**Episode**
: The episode number of the recording (whether this is available depends
on your broadcaster and/or EPG data source).

**Priority**
: The priority of the recording: Not set, Important, High, Normal, Low,
Unimportant. If there is a clash, more important recordings will take priority over
less important ones.

**Scheduled Start Time**

this includes any extra time defined in the recording profile (e.g.
“start two minutes earlier than the EPG start time”).

**Scheduled Stop Time**
: The date and time when the scheduled recording will stop. Note that this
includes any extra time defined in the recording profile (e.g. “finish
recording five minutes after the EPG stop time”).

**Duration**
: The total duration of the scheduled recording, including any extra time
before or after.

**File Size**
: The current file size of the in progress recording, this will continue to increase until the recording is complete.
