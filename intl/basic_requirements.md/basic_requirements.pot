msgid "It's perfectly possible to install and run Tvheadend as a single-seat installation, with the software running on the same system as any client software (e.g. Kodi), with all files stored locally."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternatively, you can run Tvheadend on a server, perhaps on an always-on system that houses your media, perhaps on a dedicated low-power system - it's your choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "Where you have aerial/coax connections might influence your choice - unless you use SAT>IP or have some other way to transport your TV signal over a LAN, your Tvheadend installation has to live where you can actually connect your tuners."

msgid "- pre-built binaries are available for most Debian-based distributions (Debian itself, Ubuntu, Mint...) and RPMs for Fedora, or you can build it yourself. It runs on both 32- and 64-bit x86 and ARM processors, and so also can be built for Android (which uses the Linux kernel)."

msgid "Tvheadend is intended to be lightweight, so it will run on a NAS or similar"

msgid "low-powered CPU"

msgid ". Note that the exception here is transcoding: if you want to convert high-definition video in real time then you will need a powerful, multi-core system. It will happily run in less than"

msgid ", and many people run it successfully on original Raspberry Pis with perhaps only 256MB of usable free memory. This does depend on what else you're using the computer for, though, as a GUI will drain your system as will any serious file serving."
