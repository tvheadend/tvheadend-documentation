msgid "It's perfectly possible to install and run Tvheadend as a single-seat installation, with the software running on the same system as any client software (e.g. Kodi), with all files stored locally."

msgid "Alternatively, you can run Tvheadend on a server, perhaps on an always-on system that houses your media, perhaps on a dedicated low-power system - it's your choice."

msgid "Tvheadend is intended to be lightweight, so it will run on a NAS or similar"
